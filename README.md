### WIP


Basic project that gets you a weather report using Openweathermap API.

Get your API key at https://openweathermap.org/api and use it in config.php in a format of:
```
<?php
const openweathermap_api_key = 'xxxyyyzzz';
```
For API request by city ID use cityid that can be found at https://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/
